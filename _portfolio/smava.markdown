  [Smava](https://www.smava.de) offers a peer-to-peer lending service as well as
  a comparison of traditional bank credit offers. I helped smava kickstart the
  reimplementation of their signup funnel. Since new clients need to enter a lot
  of data, they wanted to create a client-side, multi-step sign up wizard. I was
  training the team on current JavaScript techniques and frameworks, consulting
  on the overall design of the software, as well as helping with the
  implementation.

Technologies involved
---------------------

* [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/) - JavaScript module loader
* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) - JavaScript MV\* library
* [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) - JavaScript utility library

The server side rendering was implemented using JEE, while my work was limited
to writing JSP templates and creating a set of JSTL tags to simplify the usage
of common markup building blocks.
