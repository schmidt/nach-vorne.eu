  [Crewmeister](https://www.crewmeister.com/) is a software-as-a-service
  enterprise, dedicated to help small and medium sized companies manage all the
  necessary paper work when you are having employees. When Crewmeister was
  founded in 2014, they were looking for a senior developer who could help
  kickstart their platform. Together we build the first two products that would
  become part of the Crewmeister tool portfolio and launched a cross-platform
  mobile app. About 6 months after my first day they got their first paying
  customer.
