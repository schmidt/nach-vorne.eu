Hi, my name is Gregor Schmidt. I am a freelance web developer living in Berlin.
I spend most of my professional life doing Rails and JavaScript development. I
have been doing a lot of Redmine development during my career.

I spend most of my personal life with my family, my wife and our two little
kids, on Berlin's play grounds.


Skills
------

I am working with Ruby on Rails since 2005. I have detailed knowledge of Ruby's
standard library and its meta programming capabilities.

I have been working on JavaScript driven web applications since 2006. I am
comfortable with DOM APIs as well as jQuery and Backbone.js. I have worked with
require.js, underscore.js/lodash, and machina.js.

I am familiar with JS and CSS pre-processors like CoffeeScript, Less, Scss, and
Stylus.

When developing web applications I like to keep an eye on accessibility,
responsiveness, and progressive enhancement. I believe this leads to better code
structure and more robust applications.

I am also good at picking up new frameworks, since I will probably know most of
their concepts from other projects.

Employment
----------

#### Planio GmbH <small>09/2015 -- 04/2016 -- Freelance</small>


[Planio](https://plan.io) offers a web-based project management solution based
on the open source software [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org). Planio just
updated their service to support small screen and wanted to add mobile apps for
Android and iOS to their offering to make it easier for users to use their
service on smart phones and tablets. Since I am an experienced Redmine developer
and since I had created [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) based apps
before, they asked me for help. At the end of the project, we've released apps
to iTunes and Google Play, supporting push notifications, file downloads and
basic sharing functionality.


My work at Planio covered the development of the Cordova based hybrid app,
creating a Redmine plugin which would manage interaction with the app and
improving responsiveness of the Planio/Redmine user interface.

#### Crewmeister GmbH <small>08/2014 - 03/2015 -- Freelance</small>

[Crewmeister](https://www.crewmeister.com/) is a software-as-a-service
enterprise, dedicated to help small and medium sized companies manage all the
necessary paper work when you are having employees. When Crewmeister was
founded in 2014, they were looking for a senior developer who could help
kickstart their platform. Together we build the first two products,
time-tracking and vacation planning, that would become part of the Crewmeister
tool portfolio. Furthermore we launched a cross-platform mobile app.

The project was build using a Ruby on Rails backend paired with a Backbone.js
based single page app frontend written using CoffeeScript. After the first two
minimum viable products were build, I focussed on creating a Cordova based
hybrid mobile app which wraps the web app into a native application
environment.

#### Pidoco GmbH <small>08/2013 - 07/2014 -- Freelance</small>

Pidoco is a web application to quickly create interactive wireframes and UI
prototypes. Furthermore Pidoco is an web agency, offering Adobe Experience
Manager AEM development.

During my time at Pidoco I was working with Adobe, Basel, to implement an HTML
based [image
editor](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/ref/coral-ui/docs/2.17.0-granite-004/imageeditor.html)
which would be used within the editing environment of AEM and other Adobe
products. The image editing is mainly based on CSS3 transformations.


<br/>


#### Smava GmbH <small>10/2012 - 08/2013 -- Freelance</small>

[Smava](https://www.smava.de) offers a peer-to-peer lending service as well as a
comparison of traditional bank credit offers. I helped smava kickstart the
reimplementation of their signup funnel. Since new clients need to enter a lot
of data, they wanted to create a client-side, multi-step sign up wizard. I was
training the team on current JavaScript techniques and frameworks, consulting on
the overall design of the software, as well as helping with the implementation.

We were using Backbone.js with underscore.js templates to structure the
client-side single-page application. My main responsibility was to coach
smava's Java developers on JavaScript, so we kept the amount of JavaScript
frameworks and techniques at a reasonable minimum.

#### Finn GmbH <small>04/2008 - 04/2012 -- Employed</small>

Finn GmbH was a web development agency, specialized on Ruby on Rails projects.
The customers were mainly large companies like Siemens and Telekom. Finn offered
business process related consulting supported with custom software development.
During my later days at Finn, we focussed on custom Redmine development to adapt
its project management capabilities to the customer's needs.

I was a senior developer, leading teams of varying sizes and being technical
contact for our customers. I was working with Ruby, Rails and plain JavaScript.

Education
---------

#### M.Sc. in Software Engineering

[Hasso Plattner Institute](https://hpi.de/), Potsdam, in 2008. The topic of
my master's thesis was "Modularization of Web Applications Using
Context-oriented Programming".

I have developed a Context Oriented Programming (COP) API for Ruby called
[ContextR](https://github.com/schmidt/contextr/) and used it to build a basic
web application. In the paper, I described how COP enabled new ways to structure
application logic. Furthermore I argued that these new patterns improved
maintainability and software quality.


#### B.Sc. in Software Engineering

[Hasso Plattner Institute](https://hpi.de/), Potsdam, in 2005. The topic of
our bachelor project was "Generating Web Applications using Business Process
Models"

Our team build a software generator which would take a BPMN model using well
defined process steps as input and in turn generate a Ruby on Rails applications
which would implement the described process. The aim of the project was to ease
maintaining a large set of similarly structured web applications, were each one
would implement a slightly different booking and approval process.
