<p><del>Welcome. More to come lateron. At first I will fight with deployment.</del></p>
<pre><code>ruby -e "puts 'Hello World'"</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Done. It works pretty well. Not superfast but acceptable. I use Apache2.2 with proxy_balancer and 2 Mongrel working in the back ... an a virtual server.</p>

<p>This blog will serve as documentation for my master's thesis and my regular thoughts on Ruby. Rails, Web2.0, and other buzz words that make you win. I hope you'll enjoy your stay. More information will come lateron, when I finally started working in it.</p>
