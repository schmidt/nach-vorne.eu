I think every great product deserves merchandising articles - so shall my thesis
and ContextR. Therefore I created a logo/cartoon that represents my favourite
typing discipline.

If anyone is interested in it, as I am, you may create your own products in the
[(German) spreadshirt
shop](http://www.spreadshirt.net/de/DE/Duck-Typing/Motive-63/Marketplace/Designs/detail/design/4259183).
If you are having problems feel free to leave a comment or send a mail.
