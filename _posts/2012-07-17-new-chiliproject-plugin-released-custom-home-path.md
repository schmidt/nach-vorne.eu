I have just released a new [ChiliProject](https://www.chiliproject.org/) plugin.

## Custom Home Path for ChiliProject

It allows you to redirect users from the ChiliProject home page to any other
path. This might be useful, if you are using ChiliProject as a kind of CMS and
would like to customize the first page, your users will see. You may find the
plugin on its [GitHub project
page](https://github.com/schmidt/chiliproject_custom_home_path). There is also a
detailed README with installation instructions, requirements and all the bells
and whistles.
