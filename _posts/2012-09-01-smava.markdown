  [Smava](https://www.smava.de) offers a peer-to-peer lending service as well as
  a comparison of tranditional bank credit offers. I helped smava kickstart the
  reimplementation of their signup funnel. Since new clients need to enter a lot
  of data, they wanted to create a client-side, multi-step sign up wizard. I was
  training the team on current JavaScript techniques and frameworks, consulting
  on the overall design of the software, as well as helping with the
  implementation.
