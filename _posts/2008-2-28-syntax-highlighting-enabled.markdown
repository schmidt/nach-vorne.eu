title: Syntax Highlighting enabled
---
Were you as annoyed as I was about this site having no syntax highlighting but loads of code examples. The times they are a-changing. Thanks to [Dan Webb](http://svn.danwebb.net/external/CodeHighlighter/) for the JavaScript and [Henrik](http://henrik.nyh.se/tumble/) for the CSS.
