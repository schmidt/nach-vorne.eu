During my master's project, I am implementing an context-oriented programming
(COP) language extension for Ruby - ContextR.

You may find more information about COP at
[www.swa.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/cop](http://www.swa.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/cop).

ContextR is hosted on [RubyForge](http://rubyforge.org/projects/contextr) and is
release as a gem. For additional information see the [API
documentation](http://contextr.rubyforge.org/contextr) and the [project
page](http://contextr.rubyforge.org)
