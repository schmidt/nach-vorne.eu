I'm still in the Ruby field. I just started to look at Camping a Ruby
Microframework for web applications, written by the glorious \_why. Since there
is little information/documentation on the net, I'd like to point you to my
favourite ones:

* [polzr.goes :Camping](http://polzr.blogspot.com/) is a blog, that may be read
  as Camping tutorial and gives good code snippets to learn from
* RDoc - I recommend the documentation delivered with the camping gem over [the
  official one](http://camping.rubyforge.org/files/README.html). You may access
  it easily with `gem_server` at your [local
  machine](http://localhost:8808/doc_root/camping-1.5/rdoc/index.html). Although
  they contain the same information, I prefer the standard layout
* and of course the [Camping Wiki](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/)
  with information on installation and deployment and some useful hints here and
  there
