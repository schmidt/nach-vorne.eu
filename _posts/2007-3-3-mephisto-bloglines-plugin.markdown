<p>In order to prove my latest theory (ref: <a href="http://www.nach-vorne.de/2007/3/1/written-in-ruby">Written in Ruby</a>) I just wrote my first Mephisto Plugin. You are now able to include your <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> blog roll into your <a href="http://www.mephistoblog.com">mephisto</a> blog. Since I may not give you anonymous svn access I provide <a href="http://www.nach-vorne.de/assets/2007/3/3/mephisto_bloglines.tgz">a downloadable tgz</a>. All the things you need to know may be found in the README. To install it, just extract the file to your <code>vendor/plugins</code> directory.</p>

    cd /tmp
    wget http://www.nach-vorne.de/assets/2007/3/3/mephisto_bloglines.tgz
    tar zxvf mephisto_bloglines.tgz /your/mephisto/dir/vendor/plugins

<p>Restart your server afterwards and follow the instructions in the README. The code is licensed under the Ruby license. If you have any problems or feature requests, please leave a comment or drop me a line via mail.</p>

<em>Please note, that this post was initially published on a different site. The
above mentioned plugin is no longer available -- just like bloglines or
mephisto.</em>
