Today the dates for [Euruko
2007](http://www.approximity.com/cgi-bin/europeRuby/tiki.cgi?c=v&p=Euruko07)
where announced.

> 10th and 11th November 2007 - Vienna, Austria

I would give a talk about ContextR, but this was already covered successfully by
[Christian Neukirchen in
2005](http://chneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2005/10/euruko-2005-day-one.html). So
it would just be an update and nothing new. But I'm really thinking about
getting there and meeting other ruby guys.


    Air Berlin charges 89 € for the tickets
    A Hotel room for 2 nights would be about 100 €
    Conference fee about 25 €
    Eat and Drink for 2 day about 100 €

That is 314 € - still the half of RailsConf Europe fee. We'll see.

### Update

Today, I actually booked the flight and hotel. It is 129.00 € for the flight
(Air Berlin) and 74.00 € for a half a double room, which I am sharing with
[Martin](http://blog.grundrinzip.de/).

And on the other hand. It's not yet official, but I have heard rumors stating
that RailsConf Europe 2008 will be in Berlin as well. So I'll start saving my
money from now on. This will be about 50 € per month or 1.70 € a day. Stills
sound like a lot of money. Anyway.
