Today I finished my master's thesis. Hooray. The title is "ContextR & ContextWiki - Modularisierung von Webanwendungen mit kontextorientierter Programmierung" or "Modularization of Web Applications Using Context-oriented Programming". An abstract will be available, after it was graded. The full version will be public as well, although I'm not sure when.

In the mean time, you might be happy with the code. [ContextR](https://github.com/schmidt/contextr/) and [ContextWiki](https://github.com/schmidt/context_wiki/) are available at github.
