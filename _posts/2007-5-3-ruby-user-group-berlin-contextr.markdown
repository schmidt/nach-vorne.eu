title: Ruby User Group Berlin - ContextR
---
I will hold a short introductory talk on context-oriented programming and ContextR, which will be the basis for my master's thesis, tonight. I just finished [my slides](http://www.nach-vorne.de/assets/2007/5/3/schmidt_introduction_to_contextr.pdf) and just want to share them with you.

You may always find the current development version of ContextR on [rubyforge.org/projects/contextr](http://rubyforge.org/projects/contextr). When the first version is ready to release, I will let you know.

## Update

We had great fun yesterday. Thanks to the boys and girls from [id-media](http://prodev.idmedia.com/). I got great feedback and new ideas for ContextR. Thank you all. 

In the second and larger part of the evening we talked about deployment of rails apps and heard an expert from meinprof.de - a well known german community site riding on rails. It looks like Apache 2.2, mod_proxy_balance and Mongrel clusters are the way to go. But the guys from meinprof raise the bar even higher with a super redundant setup. Starting with firewalls, load balancers, of course application servers and in the nearer future a mysql cluster. They seem to know, what they are doing.
