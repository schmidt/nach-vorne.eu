[Avi Bryant](http://smallthought.com/avi/?p=22), creator of
[Seaside](http://www.seaside.st/), brings down, what I tried to say in [Written
in Ruby](/2007/3/1/written-in-ruby). Only a Ruby implementation in Ruby will
enable significant speed improvements and allow a future development with the
current momentum.

Therefore go ahead and help the people with [Rubinius](http://rubini.us/).

*Remark*: [Christian Neukirchen](http://anarchaia.org/archive/2007/04/15.html)
added another aspect ... somehow ... but I think, this is still another level.
