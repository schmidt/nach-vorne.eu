Partly off topic, but we are all in the software business and every reader will
know what I am talking about.

Yesterday evening I got the idea, that "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
would be a great example of underspecification. So I will try to use [this movie
snippet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKAJMhJi1ko) in every new project to
stress the need for good specs. Otherwise you will get answer for question, you
never asked.
