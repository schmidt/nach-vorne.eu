I just wanted to let you know, that this blog just moved from
[mephisto](http://www.mephistoblog.com/) to [jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/).
This move will make it easier to keep the content online. While I was quit lazy
in the past years, I also do not plan to get much more active, in the forcoming
future. Having static pages, served by a rock-solid apache web server, will be
much more reliable, then the old mongrel + mod_proxy_balance setup.

Unfortunately I was not able to keep the comments. There were not many of
them, so I might copy them manually. All future post will not receive any. I
you want to comment on the posts, you may want to send an email. Apart from
that, this site will become a one-way street.
