It was way too long ago, that this site was updated. Sorry for that. Let's use
[this meme](http://upstream-berlin.com/2009/01/22/seven-things/) as opportunity
to start again.

These are the rules:

* Link your original tagger(s), and list these rules on your blog.
* Share seven facts about yourself in the post — some random, some weird.
* Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links
  to their blogs.
* Let them know they’ve been tagged by leaving a comment on their blogs and/or
  Twitter.

And here are the facts:

1. "The Ruby Ahead" is a more or less obvious variation of "The Road Ahead" - A
   book by Bill Gates covering his thoughts on the development of broad band
   internet, cloud vs. desktop computing and general predictions.
2. I really liked writing blog entries about my master's thesis, but writing the
   thesis itself was the horror.
3. I still owe [Christian Neukirchen](http://chneukirchen.org/) a paper copy of
   my thesis. He gave me permission to use the name
   [ContextR](http://www.contextr.org/) and I promised to send him a copy in
   turn.
4. I'm using [pons.eu](http://pons.eu) to write this article.
5. I've just developed my first mobile website. Everybody complaining about IE6
   should be glad.
6. The movie "Forrest Gump" brings tears to my eyes regularly.
7. I really dislike these kinds of "Stöckchen" or chain letters.

Concerning the 7th fact I will disobey the laws and not torture 7 others with
this kind of stuff.
