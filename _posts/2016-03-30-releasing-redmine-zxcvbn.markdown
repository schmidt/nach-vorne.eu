Today I stumbled upon [Dropbox's zxcvbn
library](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) and decided to create a
[Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/) plugin which adds a nice, little quality
indicator to Redmine's password fields.

And therefore I present
[redmine\_zxcvbn](https://github.com/schmidt/redmine_zxcvbn).

Installation
------------

Just head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/schmidt/redmine_zxcvbn). You may
find all the nitty gritty details in the README. If you've got the feeling, I am
missing something, just create a bug report there.
