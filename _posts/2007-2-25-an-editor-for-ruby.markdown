title: An Editor for Ruby
---
<p>In one of my first postings I'd like to mention, what I think, Ruby lacks today.</p>

<h4>A good editor</h4>

<p>I use vi, some use emacs, others like textmate. RadRails and/or RDT for Eclipse have a good feature set. Komodo Edit looks great. But they all have one great disadvantage. None of them is written in Ruby.</p>

<p>I think, the community needs a cross-plattform editor, written in Ruby and some cross-plattform gui toolkit, that renders nicely on the main ruby development systems - linux and mac os. It should be more than simple macros and text replacement (I'm refering to TextMate here).</p> 

<p>I'd like to have autocompletion both context aware and on a pattern matching file based style (everything, that vi is able to do in version 6), a class browser for all classes and not just the current file, a refactoring wizard or helper or tool or view. To cut it short, I'd like to have the Smalltalk development tools for Ruby - with one exception: the base editor. The thing with that you edit texts in Squeak is really hard to love - perhaps you can get used to it after half a year. But one could do this better. I think the Smalltalk guys started with all the interesting stuff, as I would do, and forgot about the editor itself.</p>

<p>Why should it be written in Ruby? Because then it may be edited and extended by the ones who use it. That is the only way to ensure constant development.</p>

<p>I don't know who should build this editor, but I would spent money for that.</p>
