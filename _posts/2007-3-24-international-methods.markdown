<p>I just recognized, that after setting the <code>$KCODE</code> to <code>"u"</code>, either via command line (<code>[ruby|irb] -Ku</code>) or within the script, international method names are allowed in Ruby. Examples for these are available <a href="http://www.dethix.de/?p=188">at Ruby-Mine</a>, a German Ruby blog I just found at the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails-ug.de/wiki/berlin">[Ruby|Rails] User Group Berlin</a>. I really have to show up there on their next meeting</p>
