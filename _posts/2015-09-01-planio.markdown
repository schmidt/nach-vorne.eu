  [Planio](https://plan.io) offers a web-based project management solution based
  on the open source software [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org).
  Planio just updated their service to support small screen and wanted to add
  mobile apps for Android and iOS to their offering to make it easier for users
  to use their service on smart phones and tablets. Since I am an experienced
  Redmine developer and since I had created a Cordova-based apps before, they
  asked me for help. At the end of the project, we've released apps to iTunes
  and Google Play, supporting push notifications, file downloads and basic
  sharing functionality.
