My name is Gregor Schmidt. I am a freelance web developer based in Berlin,
Germany.

I am an expert Ruby and JavaScript developer. I mainly work with Rails,
Backbone, and Bootstrap, but I am also good at picking up new frameworks, since
I will probably know most of their concepts from other projects.

I started to build web applications with Ruby on Rails in 2005 and I have since
been part of the Ruby User Group Berlin. I worked on my first Single-Page
JavaScript project in 2006. During my years of employment I was mainly working
on the Redmine source code and writing plugins for it.

Years of experience taught me to keep things simple.


I am available for hire
