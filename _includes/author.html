    My name is Gregor Schmidt. I am a freelance <strong>Ruby</strong> and
    <strong>JavaScript</strong> web developer based in Berlin, Germany. I do
    Ruby and <strong>Rails</strong> since 2005, JavaScript since 2006. I wrote
    my first <strong>Redmine</strong> plugin in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mainly work with Rails, <strong>Backbone</strong>, and
    <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, but I am also good at picking up new frameworks,
    since I will probably know most of their concepts from other projects.

    If your interested in more of my previous work have a look at

    I have also published <a href="{{ "/rates/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">my
    rates</a> for everybody to see. I would love to hear, how I may help you.
