<p>Hi, my name is Gregor Schmidt. I am a freelance web developer living in Berlin.
I spend most of my professional life doing Rails and JavaScript development. I
have been doing a lot of Redmine development during my career.</p>

<p>I spend most of my personal life with my family, my wife and our two little
kids, on Berlin’s play grounds.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>I am working with Ruby on Rails since 2005. I have detailed knowledge of Ruby’s
standard library and its meta programming capabilities. I have been following
Rails’ evolution since its early beginnings.</p>

<p>I am working on JavaScript driven web applications since 2006. I am
comfortable with DOM APIs as well as jQuery and Backbone.js. I have worked with
require.js, underscore.js/lodash, and machina.js.</p>

<p>I am familiar with JS and CSS pre-processors like CoffeeScript, Less, Sass, and
Stylus.</p>

<p>When developing web applications I like to keep an eye on accessibility,
responsiveness, and progressive enhancement. I believe this leads to better code
structure and more robust applications.</p>

<p>I am also good at picking up new libraries and frameworks, since I will probably
know most of their concepts from other projects.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="employment">Employment</h2>

<h4 id="planio-gmbh-092017--112018--freelance">Planio GmbH <small>09/2017 – 11/2018 – Freelance</small></h4>

<p><a href="https://plan.io">Planio</a> offers a web-based project management solution based
on the open source software <a href="https://www.redmine.org">Redmine</a>. During my second
time at Planio, I was extending the previously developed hybrid Cordova app to
work with the latest features of Planio and iOS and Android respectively. I was
working on Planio’s EventMachine based Team Chat server to improve its
responsiveness in high load scenarios. Furthermore I was improving the handling
of incoming mail in Planio Help Desk and giving the Help Desk configuration a
revamp to ease setup for new and existing customers.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="movinga-gmbh-072016--082017--freelance">Movinga GmbH <small>07/2016 – 08/2017 – Freelance</small></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.movinga.com">Movinga</a> is a renowned Berlin-based start-up working
to modernize the removal industry. At the time, Movinga was trying to ramp up
their development team, so that they would be able to start substituting time
consuming phone calls by sales agents with tech tools. These would empower the
client to handle most of the booking process on their own.</p>

<p>I was working as tech lead in the booking funnel team to continuously improve
and extend the customer facing features, as well as integrating the application
with different backend systems within the Movinga infrastructure landscape.
Among other things, I’ve been personally responsible to integrate new payment
providers. Furthermore, I was constantly improving the synchronisation of the
booking funnel with the Movinga backend application used by operators as well as
Salesforce used by the sales agents.</p>

<p>As tech lead I was taking part in cross-team sessions discussing Movinga’s
future architecture as well as general modes of operation within the whole tech
team. I was providing insights from my team, spreading our lessons learned to
other teams, and making sure, that my team will be able to adapt to new features
of other components in time.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="planio-gmbh-092015--062016--freelance">Planio GmbH <small>09/2015 – 06/2016 – Freelance</small></h4>

<p><a href="https://plan.io">Planio</a> offers a web-based project management solution based
on the open source software <a href="https://www.redmine.org">Redmine</a>. Planio just
updated their service to support small screens. They wanted to add mobile apps
for Android and iOS to their offering to make it easier for users to use their
service on smart phones and tablets. Since I am an experienced Redmine
developer and since I had created <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> based
apps before, they asked me for help. At the end of the project, we’ve released
apps to iTunes and Google Play, supporting push notifications, file downloads
and basic sharing functionality.</p>

<p>My work at Planio covered the development of the Cordova based hybrid app,
creating a Redmine plugin which would manage interaction with the app and
improving responsiveness of the Planio/Redmine user interface.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="crewmeister-gmbh-082014---032015--freelance">Crewmeister GmbH <small>08/2014 - 03/2015 – Freelance</small></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.crewmeister.com/">Crewmeister</a> is a software-as-a-service
enterprise, dedicated to help small and medium sized companies manage all the
necessary paper work, that comes with having employees. When Crewmeister was
founded in 2014, they were looking for a senior developer who could help
kickstart their platform. Together we build the first two products,
time tracking and vacation planning, that would become part of the Crewmeister
tool set. Furthermore we launched a cross-platform mobile app.</p>

<p>The project was build using a Ruby on Rails backend paired with a Backbone.js
based single page app frontend written using CoffeeScript. After the first two
minimum viable products were built, I focussed on creating a Cordova based
hybrid mobile app which wraps the web app into a native application
environment.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="pidoco-gmbh-082013---072014--freelance">Pidoco GmbH <small>08/2013 - 07/2014 – Freelance</small></h4>

<p>Pidoco is a web application to quickly create interactive wireframes and UI
prototypes. Furthermore Pidoco is an web agency, offering Adobe Experience
Manager (AEM) development.</p>

<p>During my time at Pidoco I was working with Adobe, Basel, on a UI component
library called <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/ref/coral-ui/home/">Coral
UI</a>. One of
my tasks was implementing an HTML based <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/ref/coral-ui/docs/2.17.0-granite-004/imageeditor.html">image
editor</a>
which would be used within the editing environment of AEM and other Adobe
products. The image manipulation is mainly based on CSS3 transformations.</p>

<h4 id="smava-gmbh-102012---082013--freelance">Smava GmbH <small>10/2012 - 08/2013 – Freelance</small></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.smava.de">Smava</a> offers a peer-to-peer lending service as well as a
comparison of traditional bank credit offers. I helped smava kickstart the
reimplementation of their signup funnel. Since new clients need to enter a lot
of data, they wanted to create a client-side, multi-step sign up wizard. I was
training the team on current JavaScript techniques and frameworks, consulting on
the overall design of the software, as well as helping with the implementation.</p>

<p>We were using Backbone.js with underscore.js templates to structure the
client-side single-page application. My main responsibility was to coach smava’s
Java developers on JavaScript. We kept the amount of JavaScript frameworks and
techniques at a reasonable minimum, to ease their transition from backend to
frontend development.</p>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<h4 id="msc-in-software-engineering">M.Sc. in Software Engineering</h4>

<p><a href="https://hpi.de/">Hasso Plattner Institute</a>, Potsdam, in 2008. The topic of
my master’s thesis was “Modularization of Web Applications Using
Context-oriented Programming”.</p>

<p>I have developed a Context Oriented Programming (COP) API for Ruby called
<a href="https://github.com/schmidt/contextr/">ContextR</a> and used it to build a basic
web application. In the paper, I described how COP enabled new ways to structure
application logic. Furthermore I argued that these new patterns improved
maintainability and software quality.</p>

<h4 id="bsc-in-software-engineering">B.Sc. in Software Engineering</h4>

<p><a href="https://hpi.de/">Hasso Plattner Institute</a>, Potsdam, in 2005. The topic of
our bachelor project was “Generating Web Applications using Business Process
Models”</p>

<p>Our team build a software generator which would take a BPMN model using well
defined process steps as input and in turn generate a Ruby on Rails applications
which would implement the described process. The aim of the project was to ease
maintaining a large set of similarly structured web applications, were each one
would implement a slightly different booking and approval process.</p>
