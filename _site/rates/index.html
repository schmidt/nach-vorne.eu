    <p>I consider honesty and openness to be a key asset for successful business
relations. Unfortunately I often observe the opposite: secrecy and hidden
agendas. I do not enjoy managing secrets and private plots. The downside is that
this weakens my position during negotiations.</p>

<p>That is why I have decided to put my rates, discounts, and general business
principals onto the website. This way everybody can check them upfront and can
decide whether they can accept these terms or not. To safe everybody some time,
I declare these terms non-negotiable.</p>

<h2 id="prices-and-discounts">Prices and discounts</h2>

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>per hour</th>

<p>All prices excluding VAT.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> <strong>short-term:</strong> Generally 5 work days or less. We agree on no minimum
amount of time upfront. Everything is handled, when it’s finished.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">**</code> <strong>long-term:</strong> Generally more than 5 work days. We talk about my expected
weekly time allocation for the project and it’s general time line upfront. We
start working and I will write monthly invoices according to the actual hours
spent on the project.</p>

<h3 id="open-source-work">Open Source work</h3>

<p>I will add another <strong>5% discount</strong> to the rates described above if my work or
large parts of it will be released under an open source license. The license
shall be accepted by the Free Software Foundation. Furthermore the work has to
be associated with my name - either by giving me the permission to release it
or, if you release it, by adding it to the credits, changelogs or commit
messages.</p>

<h2 id="fixed-bid-projects">Fixed-bid projects</h2>

<p>To be honest, I do not like fixed-bid projects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>They pose a large risk on my side. They need a lot of upfront organization.</li>
  <li>They make it difficult to handle change.</li>
  <li>They make us sit on different sides of the table - instead of working hand in
hand.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, people still ask for it, so I will offer them as well. To make the
process of price calculations transparent for you I will tell you upfront how I
will determine the price tag:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I will split up all known <strong>requirements</strong> into <strong>work packages</strong>.</li>
  <li>I will try to <strong>estimate the effort</strong> for each package separately. I will try
to be <strong>pessimistic</strong>.</li>
  <li>I will <strong>sum up</strong> the individual estimations.</li>
  <li>I will <strong>add a factor of 1.5</strong> to make sure, that bad estimates and
underspecified packages will not ruin my calculation.</li>
  <li>Additionally, I will track all the hours that I needed to come up with these
numbers and add them as well.</li>
  <li>I will determine the final sum using my long-term rates described above.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this is okay for you, we can agree on a fixed-bid project.</p>
