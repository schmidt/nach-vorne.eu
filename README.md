This repository contains some talks, I gave in the past or will give in the
future.

They are all made with the help of the slideshow gem. To build the proper HTML
files, run

  bundle install
  bundle exec slideshow -f https://raw.github.com/schmidt/slideshow-shower/master/shower.txt
  bundle exec rake
