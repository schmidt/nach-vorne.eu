Hi,

My name is Gregor Schmidt. I am a freelance **Ruby** and **JavaScript** web
developer based in Berlin, Germany. I do Ruby and **Rails** since 2005,
JavaScript since 2006. I wrote my first **Redmine** plugin in 2007.

I mainly work with Rails, **Backbone**, and **Bootstrap**, but I am also good at
picking up new frameworks, since I will probably know most of their concepts
from other projects.
