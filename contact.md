This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google,
Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on
your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The
information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including
your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the
United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will
truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the
European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European
Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and
shortened by Google servers in the USA. On behalf of the website provider Google
will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website,
compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other
services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website
provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by
Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings
on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able
to use the full functionality of this website. Furthermore you can prevent
Google’s collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by downloading and
installing the browser plug-in available under
[tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

You can refuse the use of Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An
opt-out cookie will be set on the computer, which prevents the future collection
of your data when visiting this website: [Disable Google

“anonymizeIp” to ensure an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so called
IP-masking) and data is transmitted using a secure SSL connection.
